Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is an engineering branch that takes care of analyzing, synthesizing, and manipulating signals, which are in digital form. Perhaps the most famous DSP technique is Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which can be calculated using the algorithm Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

# Understanding Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) [**[Code]**](https://github.com/OmarAlkousa/Learn-Fourier-Transform/blob/0aa07f1f7a792f38418c2c637f07dce1ddfdbf81/Understanding%20Discrete%20Fourier%20Transform%20(DFT)/Understanding_Discrete_Fourier_Transform_(DFT).ipynb)

In this notebook, we will discuss how DFT works and how to implement it to output the spectrum of the signals. The functions we've built in this notebook are under MIT License and all credits go to the authors of [this book](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/Index.html). The figures below are the signal we want to analyze its spectrum, which is represented on the right below. Also, we discussed the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform in the notebook.
